                                            <p>We are a basketball club with many teams across all age groups, from U10 to U25, for both boys and girls. We are a part of the East Perth District Basketball Association and compete with other clubs within this district. All decisions with respect to the club are made by a committee of volunteers that take on different roles and responsibilities. You can find the contact details for those volunteers <a href="contacts.html">here.</a></p>
                                            <p>You can find our social pages which contain upcoming events and other news on both <a href="https://www.facebook.com/morleyrocketsbasketball" target="_blank">Facebook</a> and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/morleyrocketsbasketball" target="_blank">Instagram</a>.</p>

                                        <div class="box">
                                            <p>Nothing! The Morley Rockets Basketball Club is a not for profit organisation. We wouldn't exist without a huge team of people who volunteer many hours of their time, all in the name of our children and the game of basketball.</p>

                                            <p>Our domestic basketball competition runs all year round and is split across two seasons, Summer and Winter, which are aligned with school terms.

                                        <h3>When can my child start playing?</h3>
                                        <div class="box">
                                            <p>Under 10s is currently our starting division and we recommend that children start playing no earlier than age 7. That being said, if you feel that your child is physically ready at a younger age, we can make exceptions. Please contact <a href="mailto:registrar@morley-rockets.com">our registrar</a> for more information.</p>
                                            <p>Alternatively, our parent organisation, the East Perth district, runs an Aussie Hoops program which introduces the skills and rules of basktball for children aged 4 and older. More information about the Aussie Hoops program can be found <a href="https://aussiehoops.basketball/program-locator/" target="_blank">here</a></p>

                                        <div class="box">
                                            <p>Age divisions are based on your child's age at the 31st of December in a given year. For example, the age divisions for the Winters 2023 season are as follows:</p>

                                            <p>Registrations open twice ahead of the Summer and Winter seasons. Keep an eye on this webpage plus follow us on our social media pages (<a href="https://www.facebook.com/morleyrocketsbasketball" target="_blank">Facebook</a> and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/morleyrocketsbasketball" target="_blank">Instagram</a>)</p>
                                            <p>You can also contact <a href="mailto:registrar@morley-rockets.com">our registrar</a> to be added to our mailing list and be notified when registrations are open.</p>

                                        <h3>If I register, will my child be guaranteed a place on a team?</h3>
                                        <div class="box">
                                            <p>We endeavour to place every registered player on a team. This is dependent on the availability of a volunteer coach, manager and a training court. The majority of our coaches are parents or family members and we ask everyone to indicate if they are able to assist at registration.</p>
                                            <p>We also do our best to accommodate requests to play with friends or join an existing team, where there is a spot available.</p>
                                            <p>In the rare event that we can't find a spot in a team or your child is allocated a team but we don't hae a volunteer coach, we will refund you the cost of our club fees.</p>

                                            <p>Training is once a week for 1 hour on at least a half an indoor basketball court. Trainings can run from Monday through to Friday and timing will depend on coaches <i>and</i> venue availability. We aim to provide at least 2 weeks notice regarding confimed training days and times ahead of the season. If the training time allocated does not work, we can look for an alternative solution, however, for your child to get the most out of basketball, we encourage them to attend every possible training session.</p>
                                            <p>We currently train at the following venues:

										<h3>What are the requirements in order to coach a team?</h3>
										<div class="box">
											<p>Every team is required to provide a coach and a manager and typically these are parents, family members or friends of players within the team.</p>
											<p>We are always looking for parents, family members and senior players to put their hand up to coach. Without a volunteer, we cannot field the team.</p>
											<p>Coaching for the first time can be nerve-wracking, but we have coach coordinators who are here to help you. If you are willing to help but don't know where to start, we have some resources below to get you going!</p>

										<h3>What does a team manager do in a team?</h3>
										<div class="box">
											<p>Each team is allocated a manager to assist with the day-to-day running of the team. Typically, they would take on the following duties:</p>
											<ul>
												<li>Setting up a team group chat</li>
												<li>Communicating the training and game times and locations to the team</li>
												<li>Be responsible for the team jerseys (handing out at the beginning of each game and collecting at the end of each game)</li>
												<li>Creating a schedule of scorers for the season and communicating with the team whose turn it is to score</li>
											</ul>
											<p>It is <strong>NOT</strong> the job of the manager to score each game. There is an expectation that scoring is done by a parent each week. There will need to be a representative of each team on the scorers' bench every week.</p>
										</div>

										<h3>How do I use the electronic scoreboard?</h3>
										<div class="box">
											<p>Each team must provide a scorer for game day and every week a different family will be rostered to score. Scoring is done electronically via a tablet. Instructions on using the table can be found <a href="https://support.playhq.com/hc/en-au/articles/900003258386-Basketball-Electronic-scoring-overview" target="_blank">here</a>. Please ask the referee on game day if you need any help or have any issues.</p>
										</div>

										<h3>Where do I find the rules?</h3>
										<div class="box">
											<p>The Morley Rockets Basketball Club plays within the East Perth Eagles Basketball district. By-laws and official rules can be found at <a href="https://www.eastpertheagles.com.au/storage/app/media/EPDBA%20Domestic%20Competition%20Bylaws%20Revised%20Version%2020%20-%20October%20%202020.pdf" target="_blank">By-Laws: Domestic Competition</a> and <a href="https://www.fiba.basketball/basketball/official-rules" target="_blank">FIBA Official Basketball Rules</a>.</p>

										<h3>When (and what) is the wind up?</h3>
										<div class="box">
											<p>Morley Rockets have a wind up at the end of each season. It is a lot of fun and is a great way for all of the players to stand up in front of their friends and family with their teammates and highlight the achievements of the season. We announce the details of the wind up towards the end of each season.</p>
											<p>Three trophies are awarded to players of each team, typically MVP, Coach's Award and a "special" award that is determined by teh coach. The coach, or another representative, provide a short speech in front of all of the other teams and players and award the trophies.</p>
											<p>Presentations are typically split into two sessions. U10-U14 in the morning and U16-U20 in the early afternoon. A bit to eat and a drink is provided to all those who attend.</p>
										</div>

										<h3>How do I find out more?</h3>
										<div class="box">
											<p>If you are already a member of a team, the best place to find out more is from your coach or manager. If they don't know the answer to your question then they will have the contact details of appropriate committee members to find out more information.</p>
											<p>If you need to contact the committee directly, then visit our <a href="contacts.html">contacts page</a> to find the contact details of our committee members.</p>
